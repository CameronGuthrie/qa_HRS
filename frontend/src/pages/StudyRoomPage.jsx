            In addition to the hotel facilities, QA recognises the need for both trainers and learners to have a separate quiet area in which to get stuff done.
          </p>

          <p>
            And whilst, as a trainer, you may choose to do that in your room, itâ€™s important for your well-being to be able to separate catching up on work admin from relaxing, and to have a quiet  area within the hotel, with full internet access in which to do that.
          </p>

          <p>
            Weâ€™ve made this as quiet and relaxing as possible with soft furnishings as well as study tables. Plenty of power sockets
            <br/>
            and views overlooking London.
          </p>

          <p>
            This area is free to all who choose to use it, but to also be mindful of others.
          </p>

          <h2>You've got this ðŸ˜‡</h2>
